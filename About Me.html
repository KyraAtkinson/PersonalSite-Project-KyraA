        <p>Hi there, my name is Kyra Atkinson and I am a 23 year old aspiring to become a Web Developer. I am an alumna of North Carolina A&T State Univerity. I graduated from this university in December of 2022 with a degree in Liberal Studies. After graduating from this bootcamp and landing a job, I plan on attending school again to earn my master's degree. I am interested in a few different careers and I plan to execute them all. I plan to become a Web Developer, Real Estate Agent, and Youtuber. Who says we cannot do all the careers we are interested in?!  </p>

        <p>  I am quite a nature person, so I love sitting outside and enjoying the sun. A few more things I love are fashion, learning new things, spending time with my family and reading during my free time. I am the oldest of 2, and I am quite the daddy's girl. Oh, and I am an extreme introvert. That is just a little bit about me! Thank you for getting to know me a little. </p>
